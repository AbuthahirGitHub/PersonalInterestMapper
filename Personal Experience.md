Problems
  The first problem I faced is , I got my search and watch history data in html format, we can read HTML data in pandas but the problem is search and watch history data it's not have table format
  So i used chatGPT to write  a script to take out useful information , I just gave a idea of how my dataset will look like , it gave me a data in csv file 
  I load my data in kaggle i changed time to time format , string to time format
